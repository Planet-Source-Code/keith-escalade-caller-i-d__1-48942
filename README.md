### Description

This is everything you could ask for in a caller id program. This will monitor your incoming calls and display them if you have caller id and if your modem supports caller id. You can select a picture for the person calling. This will also speak if desired when a person calls and save all your calls. You will need the text-to-speech engine which you can get from http://www.microsoft.com/msagent/downloads/user.asp#tts. I've seen things way worse than this cost alot of money, so take advantage of this source. This is just a beta version. Most things have been tested. Please send any of your feedback or information to improve this source to keith_escalade@yahoo.com or pm me on AIM: kescalade1
